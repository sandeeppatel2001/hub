# Brand Monitoring Findings
brandMonitoring:
  name: "Potential brand impersonation detected on dark web"
  description: |
    This finding indicates that a website or service on the dark web was discovered 
    that closely resembles your brand, potentially for phishing, fraud, or reputation 
    damage. The site may use similar domain names, logos, or content to deceive users 
    into believing it is legitimate. Such impersonation sites are commonly used for 
    credential harvesting, malware distribution, or scam operations.
  mitigation: |
    Immediately investigate the impersonation site to determine its purpose and scope. 
    Document all evidence including screenshots, URLs, and extracted data. If the site 
    is actively phishing users, coordinate with law enforcement and your legal team. 
    Issue takedown requests through appropriate channels. Alert customers through 
    official communication channels about the fraudulent site. Monitor for similar 
    domains and implement brand protection measures.
  threat: "Critical"
  impact: |
    Brand impersonation on the dark web poses severe risks including customer credential 
    theft, financial fraud, reputation damage, loss of customer trust, and potential 
    regulatory penalties. Attackers may harvest login credentials, payment information, 
    or personal data from unsuspecting users. The presence of phishing sites can lead 
    to widespread account compromises, financial losses for customers, and long-term 
    damage to brand reputation and customer confidence.

# Ransomware Monitoring Findings
ransomwareMonitoring:
  name: "Company mentioned on ransomware gang leak site"
  description: |
    This finding indicates that your company name, domain, or related keywords were 
    discovered on a ransomware gang's leak site. Ransomware groups typically publish 
    victim information on these sites to pressure companies into paying ransoms. 
    The presence of your company on such sites may indicate an active or past 
    ransomware attack, data exfiltration, or that you are being targeted.
  mitigation: |
    Immediately activate your incident response team and investigate for signs of 
    ransomware infection or data breach. Review all systems for indicators of compromise. 
    Verify data integrity and check for unauthorized access. Do not pay the ransom 
    without consulting law enforcement and legal counsel. Notify affected parties as 
    required by regulations. Engage forensic experts to determine the extent of the 
    breach. Implement enhanced monitoring and security controls.
  threat: "Critical"
  impact: |
    Discovery on a ransomware leak site indicates potential data exfiltration, system 
    compromise, operational disruption, regulatory penalties, legal liability, and 
    severe reputation damage. Leaked data may include sensitive business information, 
    customer data, intellectual property, or confidential communications. Public 
    exposure can lead to competitive disadvantage, loss of customer trust, regulatory 
    investigations, and significant financial losses from downtime and recovery efforts.

# Telegram Monitoring Findings
telegramMonitoring:
  name: "Company mentioned in threat actor Telegram channel"
  description: |
    This finding indicates that your company was mentioned in a Telegram channel 
    associated with threat actors, hackers, or cybercriminal groups. These channels 
    are often used to coordinate attacks, share stolen data, sell access to compromised 
    systems, or discuss potential targets. Mentions may indicate active targeting, 
    data trading, or discussions about vulnerabilities in your systems.
  mitigation: |
    Monitor the Telegram channel for additional context and specific threats. 
    Investigate whether any credentials, access, or data related to your company 
    are being traded. Review security logs for unauthorized access attempts. 
    Strengthen authentication mechanisms and implement MFA. Conduct security 
    awareness training for employees. Consider engaging threat intelligence services 
    to monitor ongoing discussions and potential threats.
  threat: "High"
  impact: |
    Mentions in threat actor Telegram channels indicate elevated risk of targeted 
    attacks, credential theft, data breaches, or system compromise. Threat actors 
    may be sharing vulnerabilities, selling access credentials, or coordinating 
    attacks against your infrastructure. This exposure increases the likelihood of 
    phishing campaigns, social engineering attempts, ransomware attacks, or data 
    exfiltration targeting your organization.

# Twitter Monitoring Findings
twitterMonitoring:
  name: "Company mentioned by threat actor on Twitter/X"
  description: |
    This finding indicates that your company was mentioned by a known threat actor 
    or cybercriminal on Twitter/X. Threat actors often use social media to announce 
    attacks, claim responsibility for breaches, threaten organizations, or advertise 
    stolen data. Such mentions may indicate an active attack, data breach, or that 
    your organization is being publicly targeted.
  mitigation: |
    Immediately investigate the context of the mention to determine if it relates 
    to an active attack or data breach. Review security logs and systems for signs 
    of compromise. Engage your PR and legal teams to prepare response strategies. 
    Document all evidence and report to appropriate law enforcement agencies. 
    Monitor for additional threats or leaked data. Strengthen security controls 
    and incident response capabilities.
  threat: "High"
  impact: |
    Public mentions by threat actors on social media can lead to reputation damage, 
    customer panic, regulatory scrutiny, and increased attack attempts. If the mention 
    includes leaked data or breach claims, it may result in loss of customer trust, 
    legal liability, regulatory penalties, and financial losses. Public targeting 
    can also inspire copycat attacks and increase overall threat exposure.

# Forum Monitoring Findings
forumMonitoring:
  name: "Company discussed in dark web forum"
  description: |
    This finding indicates that your company was mentioned or discussed in a dark 
    web forum. These forums are commonly used by hackers, cybercriminals, and threat 
    actors to share information about targets, trade stolen data, sell access to 
    compromised systems, or discuss attack techniques. Forum discussions may reveal 
    vulnerabilities, ongoing attacks, or criminal interest in your organization.
  mitigation: |
    Analyze the forum discussion to understand the context and specific threats. 
    Investigate whether any credentials, vulnerabilities, or access methods are 
    being shared. Review and patch any mentioned vulnerabilities. Monitor the forum 
    for ongoing discussions. Implement enhanced security monitoring and threat 
    detection. Consider engaging threat intelligence services for continuous 
    monitoring of underground forums.
  threat: "High"
  impact: |
    Discussions in dark web forums indicate that your organization is on the radar 
    of cybercriminals. This can lead to targeted attacks, credential stuffing, 
    exploitation of vulnerabilities, data breaches, or ransomware attacks. Forum 
    members may share attack tools, techniques, or stolen data, increasing the 
    risk of coordinated attacks against your infrastructure and assets.
